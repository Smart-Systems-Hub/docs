<details>
  <summary>Why is the catalog request not working?</summary>
  <p>Below are common causes and how to resolve them:</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 1: Missing client secret or vault access</strong></p>
```json
[
  {
    "message": "Unable to obtain credentials: Failed to fetch client secret from the vault with alias: edc-client-secret",
    "type": "BadGateway",
    "path": null,
    "invalidValue": null
  }
]
```
  <p>Ensure the client secret exists in the vault and that the connector has permission to read it.</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 2: Wrong DSP URL in the counterparty address</strong></p>
```json
[
  {
    "message": "<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\"/>\n<title>Error 404 Not Found</title>\n</head>\n<body><h2>HTTP ERROR 404 Not Found</h2>\n<table>\n<tr><th>URI:</th><td>/api/v1/dsp/catalog/request</td></tr>\n<tr><th>STATUS:</th><td>404</td></tr>\n<tr><th>MESSAGE:</th><td>Not Found</td></tr>\n<tr><th>SERVLET:</th><td>EDC-default</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",
    "type": "BadGateway",
    "path": null,
    "invalidValue": null
  }
]
```
  <p>Verify you are using the correct DSP URL for the counterparty.</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 3: BPN/DID not registered in BDRS or BDRS unavailable</strong></p>
```json
[
  {
    "message": "Unable to obtain credentials: Empty optional",
    "type": "BadGateway",
    "path": null,
    "invalidValue": null
  }
]
```
  <p>Confirm that the BPN and its corresponding DID entry are present in the BDRS and that the BDRS service is reachable.</p>

  <p><strong>You can also follow this document to make a catalog request: [How to make a catalog request](./Management-API-Overview#catalog-section).</strong></p>

  <summary>Why is Data Access not working?</summary>
  <p>After the EDR has been negotiated and stored, you can fetch data. Common errors include HTTP 500 and 403. Below are common causes and how to resolve them:</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 1: Provider endpoint is not working correctly</strong></p>
  <p>Ensure you set the correct provider base URL during asset creation and that the endpoint is reachable; otherwise, you may receive a 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 2: Provider endpoint is not working correctly</strong></p>
```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1" />
    <title>Error 500 Internal Server Error</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>HTTP ERROR 500 Internal Server Error</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>URI:</th>
            <td>/api/public</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>STATUS:</th>
            <td>500</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>MESSAGE:</th>
            <td>Internal Server Error</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>SERVLET:</th>
            <td>EDC-public</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```
  <p>You may see the above 500 response when the provider endpoint is secured with OAuth 2 but the asset was created without OAuth 2 credentials. Create the asset with OAuth 2 credentials configured. See: [How to create an asset if the providerâ€™s endpoint is secured with OAuth 2](How-to-work-with-oauth2-configure-endpoint.md).</p>

  <p><strong>Cause 3: Token has expired</strong></p>
```json
{
  "errors": [
    "Token has expired (exp)"
  ]
}
```
  <p>This typically results in a 403 response. Access tokens expire after 5 minutes; generate a new token and include it in the Authorization header.</p>
