# Smart Systems Hub - Manufacturing-X Learn and Explore Environment

We reduce complexity and support you in developing your own Manufacturing-X use cases. With this explore & learn environment, companies do not have to deal with data exchange formats and authentication processes — we provide these components ready-to-use. Each participant can use identities and wallets, and connectors are also provided that are used exclusively for their own use case. This allows us to focus fully on the integration applications for business value. Let’s shape the future of manufacturing together!
